            <h2>Empowering Domestic Workers and Gardeners</h2>
            <p>Since 2018, Empowering the Nation has trained hundreds of domestic workers and gardeners in Johannesburg. We offer courses designed to provide marketable skills and improve career prospects.</p>
            <p>Our courses range from six-month learnerships to short six-week programs, ensuring there's something for everyone.</p>
            <p>The SME initiative, founded by Precious Radebe, is a heartfelt endeavor to offer skills training for domestic workers and gardeners. Inspired by the lack of upskilling opportunities for her parents and elderly relatives, Precious created this training school as a means of giving back to her community. The goal is to enhance the marketability of domestic workers and gardeners, allowing them to command higher wages and pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. By gaining additional skills, these individuals can also start their own small businesses, providing them with greater financial independence and career flexibility. Many employers seek to upskill their staff to offer more specialized services, making our training programs highly valuable and in demand.</p>
